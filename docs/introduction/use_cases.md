# Use Cases for Cashu

Cashu enables private, off-chain transactions with Bitcoin and Lightning. Here are some key use cases that the Cashu Dev Kit supports.

## Mobile Wallets

Mobile apps can integrate Cashu to provide users with private, instant payments. Cashu tokens can be sent directly between users without requiring blockchain confirmations, making them ideal for in-person payments and enabling a cash-like experience on mobile devices.

## Micropayments

Due to Cashu's off-chain nature, it's perfectly suited for micropayments that would be uneconomical on the main Bitcoin blockchain. Use cases include:

- Content monetization (pay-per-article, pay-per-minute)
- In-app purchases and digital goods
- Streaming payments for services
- Gaming and virtual economies

## Privacy-Focused Services

Services that value user privacy can implement Cashu to offer payment options that don't leave a blockchain trail. This is valuable for:

- Privacy-preserving marketplaces
- Donations to organizations 
- Person-to-person payments
- Services where payment privacy is essential

## Lightning Service Providers

Lightning Service Providers (LSPs) can implement Cashu as an additional service to provide privacy-enhanced solutions for their users. This enables instant off-chain payments between users with the added privacy benefits of blind signatures.

## Web Applications

The Cashu Dev Kit can be compiled to run in web browsers, enabling web applications to implement Cashu-based payments. This allows for private payments directly in the browser without requiring specialized wallet software.

## Remittances

Cashu can be used to build remittance applications where users can send value across borders without high fees. The privacy aspects of Cashu can be especially valuable in regions where financial surveillance is a concern.
